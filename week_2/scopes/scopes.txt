usually var in scope are inner most scope
help improve clarity of the code
as we dont have to worry about a variable outside teh scopes
help reduce error like we can use same name without error
Impove resource use so if a var outside the scope then it will be lost and dispost by garbage collector
so need to be cerfull 


Static and final 
Static var are class variable they are share between all objects that belong to class used as counter
then stat var are called they refer to the same variable

final var are variable that cant be changed ones they are set. Place where they can be set is the constructor or instantiated
be can have bith static and final that mean they can't be change, they exict within the class variable 
When the final variable is called it can call its respective final var in the object.  


Static effect on methord
Static var are associated with class not object

Every object call the came single universal static Variables

We can call it without making an object with the class name
SO if the main is the same class as methord we dont need to 
specify the class name
 
we can also crate an object and refence it

Used when there is code that need to be shared for all instance in the class

Used when there is no depency on object properties 
What is object properties?
differentiate objects from other objects. The basic properties of an object are those items 
identified by its four-part name (name, type, instance, and version) and 
also include owner, status, platform, and release. info that keep changing
Static funstion are mostly used if the function is based entirly on input
and/ or alway has the same output

Static methords are unable to access instance methord and var direclty of
they cant use the this keyword as they are part of the class then the object
When ever you see staic methord that mean the methord doesnt rely on static properites

Global variables
For java all var must be inside a class,enum or interface so we can declare global var at the top level
of the code so we need to use static and/or final to access information globally

WHat is Inastance variable 
Instance variable is the variable declared inside a class,
 
What is instantiated?
instantiated mean defining or using the instant variable in another class.
